# AI-s-Financial-Market-Analysis-Using-Python
Financial market analysis of AI companies using Python to evaluate R&amp;D spending, revenue growth, and stock impact through data visualization and exploratory data analysis.

# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the financial market impact of Artificial Intelligence investments using Python. It examines how AI-driven companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta invest in Research & Development (R&D), generate AI revenue, and influence stock performance over time.
Using data analysis and visualization techniques, this project uncovers trends, correlations, and insights into how AI investments translate into financial growth and stock market impact.
