# AI-s-Financial-Market-Analysis-Using-Python
Financial market analysis of AI companies using Python to evaluate R&amp;D spending, revenue growth, and stock impact through data visualization and exploratory data analysis.

# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the financial market impact of Artificial Intelligence investments using Python. It examines how AI-driven companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta invest in Research & Development (R&D), generate AI revenue, and influence stock performance over time.
Using data analysis and visualization techniques, this project uncovers trends, correlations, and insights into how AI investments translate into financial growth and stock market impact.

# Objectives

Analyze R&D spending by AI companies
Evaluate AI revenue and revenue growth trends
Examine stock market impact due to AI developments
Compare expenditure vs revenue performance
Identify events causing maximum stock impact
Understand correlations between financial variables

# Tools & Technologies Used

Python
Pandas – Data manipulation
NumPy – Numerical operations
Matplotlib – Data visualization
